# My Website Design System

This is an off-platform project via [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/full-stack-engineer-career-path) where my own website design system that can help me establish the aesthetic, this includes the colour choices, the fonts and the text styles. 

### Why did I design a website design sytem?
I designed this because it provides a planned visual and reusable styling which could give users the appeal they need to stay on my website whilst I can also add additional features to my design improving it as well as staying consistent.  

### What programming language did I use?
I used HTML and CSS to design my project.

Here is a sample of my website so far:
